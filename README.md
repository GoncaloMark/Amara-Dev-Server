# Jalapeno

This is a File Watcher for Typescript that can provide hot reload features! Simple and light implementation suitable for small/simple projects! I made this for self improving my coding skills and to add some CLI tools to my portfolio!

## Installation

Either through cloning with git or by using [npm](http://npmjs.org) (the recommended way):

```bash
npm install -g jalapeno_lnx
```

And Jalapeno will be installed globally to your system path.

You can also install Jalapeno as a development dependency:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jalapeno_lnx
```

## Usage

```bash
jalapeno --run [filename]
```

For CLI options, use the `-h` argument:

```bash
jalapeno -h
```

## Manual restarting

If you need to manually restart your application, instead of stopping and restart Jalapeno, you can type `r` and press Enter.

## Stopping Jalapeno

Hit CTRL+C and it shutdowns Jalapeno!
